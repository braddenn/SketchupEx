How To Examples of Ruby code extensions for Sketchup CAD. Learn how to extend Sketchup.

Sketchup (sketchup.com) is a powerful, simple, free CAD, a 3-D drawing program.
The powerful part is that you can use the Ruby API to add extensions - and even create games.
While the documentation is complete with examples, none of the examples print out the results.
This makes it difficult to understand what will happen when you use a Sketchup class method.
I could not find examples on the web, even on Github - everyone is protecting their work. So I 
created lots of examples of the main operations with extensive printouts showing how objects
looked before and after operations.

All of my examples are in this repository. They all run. You may need to move the startup.skp
file to <username>/AppData/Roaming/Sketchup/Sketchup 2015/SketchUp/Plugins/extensions. I'll
check that out and make any necessary changes soon.

Feel free to make updates and add more examples. 

My next repository will be ConBot - construction robots (nanobots) build things.
